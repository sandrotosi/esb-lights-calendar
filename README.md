## Empire State Building Lights Calendar

This project generates an iCalendar for the lights display on the Empire State Building.

Data is periodically retrieved from the Empire State Building (often abbreviated as _ESB_) [website](https://www.esbnyc.com/about/tower-lights/calendar/).

You can add the iCalendar to your calendar application by clicking on [this link](https://sandrotosi.github.io/esb-lights-calendar/esb.ics).
